Simple Counter with React
React improves the creation of custom components, which you can render throughout your web-app using the ReactDOM.render() method. A custom component allows you to divide and conquer, separating logical and visual challenges into smaller pieces- giving you greater control over the display and functionalities of each part of the web-app.

For example, to create a bootstrap <Card />; component you'd code this:

function Card(props){
    return (
        <div className="card">
            <img className="card-img-top" src="http://via.placeholder.com/350x150" alt="Card image cap" />
            <div className="card-body">
                <h5 className="card-title">Card title</h5>
                <p className="card-text">Some quick example text to build on the card title and fill the card's content.</p>
                <a href="#" className="btn btn-primary">Go somewhere</a>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
After declaring it, you are able to import and use it in your webapp like this:

//import react into the bundle
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import Card from './component/Card.jsx'

ReactDOM.render(<Card />, document.querySelector('#root'));
Additionally, you can pass information through the Card component using props:


<!-- Use of the custom component -->
<Card imageUrl="http://via.placeholder.com/350x150" title="A nice image" />

... for usage within the render method of your Card component (notice the image src and card title):

//Declaration of custom component (Card.js)

function Card(props){
    return (
        <div className="card">
            <img className="card-img-top" src={props.imageUrl} alt="Card image cap" />
            <div className="card-body">
                <h5 className="card-title">{props.title}</h5>
                <p className="card-text">Some quick example text to build on the card title and fill the card's content.</p>
                <a href="#" className="btn btn-primary">Go somewhere</a>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
üå± How to start this project
Do not clone this repository because we are going to be using a different template.

We recommend opening the react boilerplate using a provisioning tool like Codespaces (recommended) or Gitpod. Alternatively, you can clone it on your local computer using the git clone command.

This is the repository you need to open or clone:

https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/react-hello
üëâ Please follow these steps on how to start a coding project.

üí° Important: Remember to save and upload your code to GitHub by creating a new repository, updating the remote (git remote set-url origin <your new url>), and uploading the code to your new repository using the add, commit and push commands from the git terminal.

üìù Instructions
Create a seconds-counter component, called SecondsCounter. It should look like this one.

The whole purpose of the component is to display how many seconds have passed since the website finished loading (onLoad).
Use the ReactDOM.render() to render the component into the web-app.
Use the setInterval() function to re-render the component on every second.
The component does not need a local state, you can pass the number of seconds as props like this:
<SecondsCounter seconds={3434} />
You can find the clock icon on the left of the component in Font Awesome.
üî• Bonus
Create an option to countdown from a given number.
Create stop, reset, and resume functionality
Create an alert when the user reaches a specified time, if the user enters "10", an alert should render notifying the user that their time was reached
